# Introduction

The ASD Counter Plugin for Obsidian counts occurrences of the placeholder "asd" in a document and displays the count in the status bar. This helps identify and replace temporary placeholder text before finalizing a document. 

I created this plugin for my LinkedIn-Blog: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-mein-eigenes-obsidian-plugin-samuel-scherrer-h4w5f
